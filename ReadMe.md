###Project Working steps

##After connecting template engines

1. First make sure that mongo db connected
2. Next steps is we need to create a database schema in model
    a. open usermodel
    b. design the db schema (ehich incluedes field names of table and data type)
    ex : user -> fieldname = data type
    name = string
    email = string
    mobile = string
    age = Number
    you can continue the fields depend on requirement now we will consider only these 4 fields
